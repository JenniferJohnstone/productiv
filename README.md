This is a project to create a productivity timer/application inspired by the pomodoro technique and other soundscape/ambient noise generator sites.  

Currently the application has: 
1. A timer that the user can set, stop or pause. 
2. A record off how many pomodoros a user has completed. 
3. A source of ambient sound or music that the user can play and adjust volume to. 
4. Browser notifications for when a session is complete. 

I am now working on making small improvements here and there when I can and implementing new features.
